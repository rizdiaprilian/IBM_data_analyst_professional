This course gives you a gentle introduction into the concepts of data analysis, the role of a Data Analyst, and the tools that are used to perform daily functions. before thougout the entire course. Moreover, you may also learn how Data Analyst performs that draw a clear distinction between this role to Data Scientist and Data Engineer.

As the course goes on, you will:
  * Gain an understanding of the data ecosystem and the fundamentals of data analysis, such as data gathering or data mining.  
  * Learn the soft skills that are required to effectively communicate your data to stakeholders, and how mastering these skills can give you the option to become a data driven decision maker.
  * Be able to summarize the data ecosystem, such as databases and data warehouses.
  * Uncover the major vendors within the data ecosystem and explore the various tools on-premise and in the cloud. Continue this exciting journey and discover Big Data platforms such as Hadoop, Hive, and Spark
  * Be able to visualize the daily life of a Data Analyst, understand the different career paths that are available for data analytics, and identify the many resources available for mastering this profession.

Key aspects to data analysis are:
  * Exploring the fundamentals of gathering data
  * Learning how to identify your data sources
  * Learning how to clean, analyze, and share your data with the use of visualizations and dashboard tools. 

This all comes together in the final project where it will test your knowledge of the course material, explore what it means to be a Data Analyst, and provide a real-world scenario of data analysis.

This course is designed to provide you with basic working knowledge for using Excel spreadsheets for Data Analysis. It covers some of the first steps for working with spreadsheets and their usage in the process of analyzing data. This course is suitable for those aspiring to take up Data Analysis or Data Science as a profession, as well as those who just want to use Excel for data analysis in their own domains.

Topics covered in this course are:
  * Data cleaning and wragling using functions and continue to expand your knowledge of analyzing data through the use of filtering, sorting, and using pivot tables.
  * An introduction to spreadsheets like Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets and loading data from multiple formats
  * The final project to show off your newly acquired data analysis skills

By the end of this course you will have worked with several data sets and spreadsheets and demonstrated the basics of cleaning and analyzing data all without having to learn any code.
